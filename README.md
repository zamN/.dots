# Howto
You can run `./importer.sh` to safely link the dotfiles in each directory for each program. It will fail if the file already exists, but tbh I highly recommend just copy/pasting what you want from each of these files rather than actually trying to use this, unless you are me :-)

# Requirements

You must have [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) installed to install these dotfiles, or manually do it yourself ;)
